        <!-- Semantic description of elements of annotation XML document

        filename: name of image file (including extension)
        database: name of image dataset
        image: source of image file (owner, author, flickr)
        imageWidth: image width [pixels]
        imageHeight: image height [pixels]
        depth: number of channels

        date: date the annotation file is generated
        time: time at which the annotation file is generated

        object: annotated image object
        modelName: name of 3D model

        viewAngle: pan, tilt, and roll angle (in radians) of the view point.
        pan: pan view angle in radians
        tilt: tilt view angle in radians
        roll: roll view angle in radians

        distanceFromCamera: distance from camera when rendering of this object was done
        distance: actual distance
        unit: units of the distance

        name: name of the annotated image object (e.g. RPG)
        objectID: unique identifier of the annotated image object within this file
        classID: unique id of this class of object - this id can be globally unique for this type of object
        occlusion: percentage of the object that is occlued - 1 for fully occluded and 0 for not occluded at all
        polygon: image region boundary
        points: list of locations of key points on the object

        pt:	point on the image region boundary (polygon corner)

        x: image axis running horizontally from left to right
        y: image axis running vertically from top to bottom

        objectParts: Ids of other annotated image objects defined as parts of current image object
