#+TITLE: List of tasks in SIGHTT

<tab> to expand in emacs

** DONE Lighting [1/1]
- [X] Add background image to advanced lighting
  
** TODO TaskConsumer [8/10]
- [ ] When doing a single image, default orientation is off by 90 degrees (from front rather than side)
- [X] Flag to clean up old directories when done with them (how to do debug???)
- [X] Improve shadows (too dark!,  WAS:  too light)
- [X] Show shadow on ground-plane
- [X] Fix ground clipping (evaluate lowest point relative to ground plane, not lowest Z)
- [X] Use alpha channel from render explicitly during compositing 
- [X] Fix rotation code;  Peter reports that orientations selected are not what is returned
- [X] Ensure that model appears on all backgrounds, when ground plane is selected   <-- NOTE:  removed because went to single background
- [X] Scale down directional brightness 
- [ ] LOW: use configuration for Blender location (vice /opt/blender/blender)
- [ ] LOW: Put the 'Point' where it touches the ground, for shadow-based renders

** TODO User Interface [14/18]
- [X] Make sure can run without S3
- [X] Handle case where 10 degree is selected, unselect all but one, and then continue.  Page goes blank.
- [X] Remove message on background page to Add background to list
- [X] Change message on Step 4
- [X] Remove duplicate code from thingiloader / modelview.js
- [X] Determine if aspectHandler.js and limitedAspects.js are both needed.  See top of limitedAspects.js
- [X] Hand-entered number of images can mis-parse
- [X] Multiple backgrounds with different sizes breaks location setting  <-- NOTE:  removed because went to single background 
- [X] Remove multiple backgrounds
- [X] Show all 4 vertices in model view (vice making triangles out of them)
- [X] Rectangle locations break TaskService when creating jobs
- [X] Set default lighting model slightly in front and to left (elevation:  1.225/75 deg, azimuth: -1.9/-110)
- [X] Turn off ComputeResource in dev mode
- [X] LOW: Show image size on image select page
- [ ] LOW: Ground plane does not get cloned or it does not show up when in advanced
- [ ] LOW: Make model loading faster; possibly cache obj file in browser?
- [ ] LOW: Use blank background of arbitrary size
- [ ] LOW: Allow download of models files that you own

** DONE Models [7/7]
- [X] Change auto-loaded RPG to match default image, make sure good quality
- [X] Add additional default models
- [X] Find cameras by type, rather than name
- [X] Do not upload thumbnails, make it load models
- [X] Check licensing on models 
- [X] Continue to parse bad obj files
- [X] Handle 2-element 'f' elements in obj files

** DONE Messaging [3/3]
- [X] Stop timeout of listeners in TaskService
- [X] Rename 'objectName' to 'modelName' in BaseRenderMessage. Confusing since there is an '.obj' file. 
- [X] Rename 'objectKey' to 'modelKey' in BaseRenderMessage

** DONE Summary Page [4/4]
- [X] Add ground plane info
- [X] Theta -> Azimuth
- [X] Phi -> Elevation
- [X] Radians -> Degree

** DONE Ground Plane [6/6]
- [X] Set size correctly in select ground plane selection
- [X] Slider in ground plane needs to show starting grid size
- [X] Improve description of ground plane
- [X] Background tab needs to be active when in ground plane selection (in wizard)
- [X] Don't pop up text after clicking on advanced ground plane
- [X] Use selected background, not first in list, for background in ground plane

** TODO JobZipper [3/5]
- [X] Timing issues
- [X] Issues waiting for last file
- [X] Single image jobs don't zip properly
- [ ] LOW: Handle server restart (i.e. reset of job numbering) gracefully
      -- On-restart, send jz reset message
      -- For each job, have unique UUID.  Use UUID as internal ID, not jobID
      -- Check with DB that the UUID is, in fact, unique
- [ ] LOW: Use Camel with JobZipper.  Reconsider using Camel everywhere.

** TODO FAQ [0/3]
- [ ] Add more ground-plane to FAQ
- [ ] Add more information to FAQ on rotations, re. conversation with Peter
- [ ] Re-create FAQ model images as default orientation has changed

** Other [4/4]
- [X] Create license for SIGHTT
- [X] Pull all licenses for dependencies and put into license/ dir
- [X] Add new disclaimer re. Public Release Center 
- [X] Change the license / copyright statement to 3-clause BSD for everything 

** DONE Cross-Browser [3/4]
- [ ] IE 11 issue for carousel; does not show images when console is not up
- [X] Make sure works on Peter's browser (FF 31, issues with orientation interface)
- [X] Test on other browsers (determine how far back??)
- [X] Make sure all references to console are wrapped, solve IE console issue

- M-left to promote , M-right to demote headline
- Put TODO at beginning to make a todo list, add '[0/0]' to have progress at end of line

- Use C-c C-t to toggle TODO state to DONE state

** Lists
- unordered start with '-', '*', or '+'
- ordered start with 1.
- Descriptions start with '::'
- Checkbox start with [ ]
- Toggle checkbox with C-c C-c
