                               The material was modified by rotating and scaling
			       the object, modifying the lights, and changing
			       the location of the camera.  The Blender Render
			       version is used, rather than the Blender Game
			       (default) version.  The modified file is

                               The material was modified by removing two of the 
			       drums, adding a light, and changing the location
			       of the camera.  The modified file is distributed
			       here under the same license as the original.
